Appointments scheduling api

- Doctor and Patient can signup and login
- Patients schedules appointments with chosen Doctor
- Doctor receives realtime new appointment notification
- maybe a chat for doctors to communicate with patients in realtime
- unit test + e2e w/ supertest

==============================REASONS==================
- could've done a few things differently such as using apollo graphql or something like that.
however, i chose to build the api this way because i decided to follow woovi-playground's conventions
